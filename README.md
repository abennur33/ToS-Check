# ToS Check Chrome Extension

## Overview
ToS Check is a Chrome extension that allows users to easily check information about the Terms of Service (ToS) for websites they visit. The extension provides two main functions:
1. By clicking on the extension icon, users can quickly access information about the ToS of the current website they are browsing.
2. The extension uses an algorithm to detect when the user is on a sign-up page, and it will prompt the user to check information about the ToS of the website they are signing up for with a convenient popup.

## How to Use
### Function 1 - Checking ToS for the Current Website:
1. Install the extension (see instructions below).
2. While browsing any website, click on the ToS Checker extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
3. A popup will appear displaying the Terms of Service information for the current website, if available.

### Function 2 - Automatic Prompt on Sign-Up Pages:
1. Install the extension (see instructions below).
2. Visit any website with a sign-up or registration page.
3. The extension will automatically detect if it's a sign-up page and prompt you to check the Terms of Service information with a popup.
